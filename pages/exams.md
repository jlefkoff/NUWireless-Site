# Amateur Radio Licensing Exams

## What is an amateur radio license?

From the FCC
> "The amateur and amateur-satellite services are for qualified persons of any age who are interested in radio technique solely with a personal aim and without pecuniary interest. These services present an opportunity for self-training, intercommunication, and technical investigations. Twenty-nine small frequency bands throughout the spectrum are allocated to this service internationally."

There are three amateur radio license classes in the US: Technician, General, and Amateur Extra. At NU Wireless, we offer all three license class exams for **free** for all current students. This is an excellent opportunity to learn a new skill, and it looks great on your resume!

## What does the exam look like?

The exam format is multiple choice, and there are more questions depending on the license you're trying to obtain. The technician license is the easiest, and we recommend you study for all of the exams using the [Hamstudy.org website](https://ham.study).

## What Should I Bring to the Exam?

The exam is administered electronically, so you must bring a laptop. A calculator is also allowed, but you must clear the memory before the exam. You are also encouraged to bring scratch paper and a writing utensil.

## Upcoming Exams

We generally hold exams on the third Thursday of each month from 6 to 7pm. Please sign up for the exam you wish to take below.
