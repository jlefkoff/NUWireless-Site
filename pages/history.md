# Club History

The Wireless club has existed in some form as a group of people interested in the art of electronics experimentation for a long time. Amateur radio took off in the early 20th century, and many colleges across the US formed clubs. At one point, there was enough student interest in amateur radio that the University gave the club a physical space in Hayden hall when the building was constructed in 1956. We continue to experiment in the space, like the many generations before us!
