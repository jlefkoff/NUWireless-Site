## Who are we?

![](/img/club-s24.webp)

Founded in 1922, we're the oldest running club on campus! Originally *just* an amateur radio club, we're now so much more. From electronics education through outreach and workshops, to amazing projects and speakers, plus **free** licensing exams, we are Northeastern University's premier electronics experimentation club.

-------------------------

## Weekly Meetings

We hold meetings in our lab space at 503 Hayden Hall on Thursday evenings at 7pm. We serve free pizza and host interesting talks from students, professors, alumni, and more.

## Amateur Radio Details

We employ a pair of Icom 7610 HF radios fed into a JK Antennas MidTri-40 Yagi on a 40â€™ Rohn 45G tower. An 80m dipole rounds out the station equipment giving us a solid HF station for 10m-80m. We have computers for logging and digital modes, and an ACOM 200A amplifier for added power.

The club also sponsors a VHF repeater on the roof of West Village H:

`145.31- PL 123.0`
